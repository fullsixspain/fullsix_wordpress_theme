# FullSIX WordPress Theme

This is a base theme that is made to be extended. It should be used with [FullSIXWordPressBundle](https://github.com/fullsixspain/FullSIXWordPressBundle)
and may be used as well in conjunction with [fullsix_wordpress_plugin](https://github.com/fullsixspain/fullsix_wordpress_plugin).

This is a theme that uses Twig for rendering. Before using the theme, you should edit customize it to setup
the path for your twig template (for example, "MyWebBundle:WP:%s.html.twig"). By default it will search in "::%s.html.twig".
"%s" will be replaced by the page template.
